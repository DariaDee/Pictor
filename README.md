Pictor was a part of an end of year degree show at Goldsmiths University. Metasis was the result of a year of intense study, equally focused on technical and critical aspects of computational arts. The works on show illustrated the versatility of computational applications when introduced to fine art. They demonstrated interactive, generative and procedural techniques, ranging from critiquing the autonomy of the system to the role of the artist.
